🎗 Breast Cancer Prediction Using Deep Learning | Image Classification Project

I recently completed a deep learning project focused on predicting breast cancer using an MNIST-style medical imaging dataset. The goal was to build an end-to-end CNN-based model capable of classifying images as benign or malignant, supporting early detection and diagnostic decision-making.

🧠 What I Built:

Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch for image classification

Implemented data preprocessing: normalization, resizing, reshaping, augmentation

Utilized TensorFlow/Keras for model creation, training, and evaluation

Performed training optimization using dropout, batch normalization, early stopping, and learning-rate scheduling

Evaluated model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and loss/accuracy plots

✨ Key Highlights:

Achieved high classification accuracy on test data

Demonstrated how CNNs can extract meaningful features from medical images

Showcased a scalable and reproducible deep learning pipeline

Reinforced the role of AI in medical imaging and diagnostic support

💡 Why It Matters:
Breast cancer detection is time-critical. Deep learning models can assist doctors by providing fast, consistent, and data-driven insights. This project strengthened my skills in DL modeling, image preprocessing, evaluation, and healthcare analytics.
